                <h1>Biography</h1>
                <p>After a successful degree in computer science, I have developed strong skills and interests towards web development and all technologies related to this domain.</p>
                <p>I have been working for multiple companies on various projects, from a small website for a new startup to a full single page application deployed on the cloud with thousands of users.</p>
                <p>During my work experience, I have discovered and adopted the agile methodologies (Scrum, Kanban, Lean, ...). I think that the customer relationship and business value should be the most important points to develop when working in a team and I always try to be as efficient as possible.</p>
                <p>I enjoy spending time learning the latests innovation, be it a new javascript framework or a new language targeted towards web development.</p>
